We show that the reconstruction weights computed by\\nLLE capture the high-dimensional structure of the neighborhoods, and not the\\nlow-dimensional manifold structure. Consequently, the weight vectors are highly\\nsensitive to noise. Moreover, this causes LLE to converge to a linear\\nprojection of the input, as opposed to its non-linear embedding goal. To\\novercome both of these problems, we propose to compute the weight vectors using\\na low-dimensional neighborhood representation. We prove theoretically that this\\nstraightforward and computationally simple modification of LLE reduces LLE's\\nsensitivity to noise. This modification also removes the need for\\nregularization when the number of neighbors is larger than the dimension of the\\ninput. We present numerical examples demonstrating both the perturbation and\\nlinear projection problems, and the improved outputs using the low-dimensional\\nneighborhood representation.\\n\"}}, {'_index': 'ssd-search', '_id': '_1ZgD4QBnvXQquafQD_W', '_score': 1.6866598, '_source': {'id': 8446, 'abstract': '  We introduce a way to represent word pairs instantiating arbitrary semantic\\nrelations that keeps track of the contexts in which the words in the pair occur\\nboth together and independently.
