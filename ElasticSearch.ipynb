Much of the effort concentrates on\\nbuilding latent variables which can be used in prediction problems, such as\\nclassification and regression. A related goal of learning latent structure from\\ndata is that of identifying which hidden common causes generate the\\nobservations, such as in applications that require predicting the effect of\\npolicies. This will be the main problem tackled in our contribution: given a\\ndataset of indicators assumed to be generated by unknown and unmeasured common\\ncauses, we wish to discover which hidden common causes are those, and how they\\ngenerate our data. This is possible under the assumption that observed\\nvariables are linear functions of the latent causes with additive noise.\\nPrevious results in the literature present solutions for the case where each\\nobserved variable is a noisy function of a single latent variable. We show how\\nto extend the existing results for some cases where observed variables measure\\nmore than one latent variable.\\n', 'categories': 0, 'title': 'Measuring Latent Causal Structure', 'paper_id': 1001.1079, 'update_date': '2010-01-08'}}, {'_index': 'ssd-search', '_id': 'DQUGKoQBAlqJc8Yl-hnl', '_score': 1.6678728, '_source': {'Authors': \"[['Turney', 'Peter D.', '', 'National Research Council of Canada']]\", 'id': 572, 'abstract': '  Many AI researchers and cognitive scientists have argued that analogy is the\\ncore of cognition.

In such a scheme, objects are represented as a set of\\nspatially distributed local features, or parts, arranged in stereotypical\\nfashion. To encode the local appearance and to represent the relations between\\nthe constituent parts, there has to be an appropriate memory structure formed\\nby previous experience with visual objects. Here, we propose a model how a\\nhierarchical memory structure supporting efficient storage and rapid recall of\\nparts-based representations can be established by an experience-driven process\\nof self-organization. The process is based on the collaboration of slow\\nbidirectional synaptic plasticity and homeostatic unit activity regulation,\\nboth running at the top of fast activity dynamics with winner-take-all\\ncharacter modulated by an oscillatory rhythm. These neural mechanisms lay down\\nthe basis for cooperation and competition between the distributed units and\\ntheir synaptic connections. Choosing human face recognition as a test task, we\\nshow that, under the condition of open-ended, unsupervised incremental\\nlearning, the system is able to form memory traces for individual faces in a\\nparts-based fashion. On a lower memory layer the synaptic structure is\\ndeveloped to represent local facial features and their interrelations, while\\nthe identities of different persons are captured explicitly on a higher layer.\\nAn additional property of the resulting representations is the sparseness of\\nboth the activity during the recall and the synaptic patterns comprising the\\nmemory traces.\\n', 'categories': 0, 'title': 'Experience-driven formation of parts-based representations in a model of\\n  layered visual memory', 'paper_id': 905.2125, 'update_date': '2015-03-13'}}, {'_index': 'ssd-search', '_id': '7AYNKoQBAlqJc8YlU4TN', '_score': 1.6646941, '_source': {'Authors': \"[['Gregor', 'Karo', ''], ['LeCun', 'Yann', '']]\", 'id': 93723, 'abstract': '  We introduce a new neural architecture and an unsupervised algorithm for\\nlearning invariant representations from temporal sequence of images.

       "0    A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is\\npresented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All\\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\\nselection of events.\\n   \n",
